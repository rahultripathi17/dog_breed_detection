# dog_breed_detection
Dog breed detection is a computer vision task that involves identifying the breed of a dog in an image using machine learning algorithms. It typically involves training a deep neural network on a large dataset of annotated images of different dog breeds, which can then be used to accurately classify new images of dogs based on their breed.
